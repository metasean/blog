<h2 id="_background">Background</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the spring of 2014 I decided I needed a change and decided I wanted to become a JavaScript full stack programmer.  I started attending [UtahJS] meetups in the Salt Lake City area.  Early that summer there was a UtahJS Conference.  While attending I met another novice JS developer.  We were both really happy to see each other at the next UtahJS meetup.  After that meetup, we were talking about how hard it was to learn code in isolation, and thus was born the SLC JS Learners' group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since that fateful day, the SLC JS Learners' group has grown to more than 600 members, so big we&#8217;re actually merging into the UtahJS group, and I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of novices up and running!  The following resources are the things I most frequently share with my fellow learners.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_start_here">Start Here</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><mark><strong><em><a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> is the the one JavaScript resource that I can&#8217;t recommend highly enough for Learners!</em></strong></mark></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Assumes no knowledge coming in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides a linear progression from no knowledge to a portfolio of web applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets you move as fast or slow as you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets you skip lessons and topics you&#8217;re already familiar with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has phenomenal online support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In late 2015, they did change the site design, making the skip process less intuitive - to skip lessons, open your "Map" and click on the lesson you would like to complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another great resource for any novice and junior developer is <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbie</a>.  It&#8217;s more about the social and networking aspects of entering the programming world.  They have a bunch of different things including a pretty active forum and a blog.  They also do a weekly podcast, which is really good (but remember, if it comes down to listening to a podcast OR working through freeCodeCamp - CODE!) They also have a learning resources section, but it&#8217;s mostly bootcamps that require money or being on location for many consecutive weeks, or resources that simply aren&#8217;t as comprehensive, and learner-friendly as freeCodeCamp.  (freeCodeCamp really is the best resource I&#8217;ve seen for learning in a guided, thorough, and progressive way!)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_goto_reference">The goto Reference</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> is the best definitive JavaScript reference.  As a novice, it can be overwhelming.  I encourage you to continue referencing it as you make your way through FreeCodeCamp and other resources.  Bit by bit, you will start to "grok" the MDN documents and come to love them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>p.s. <code>goto</code> is a common command in many programming languages, and is a reserved word in JavaScript.  To get an idea of community acceptance of <code>goto</code>, check out <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/292/">xkcd: goto</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_glimpse_under_the_hood">Glimpse Under the Hood</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you start actually coding in JavaScript, you will likely start to wonder what is happening under the hood.  To get a glimpse, I recommend running your code through the <a href="http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit">JavaScript version of the PythonTutor</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dive_deep">Dive Deep</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten through the "Basic JavaScript" exercise, I recommend you start to learn more about how JavaScript works "under the hood".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/">Anthony Alicea’s "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts"</a> dives deep into the workings of JavaScripts. Where Free Code Camp will help you understand how to make web applications, <em>The Weird Parts</em> will help you understand why JavaScript does what it does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure to check <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/udemy.com">Retail Me Not</a> for current discounts (there’s almost always one!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already started using <a href="http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit">JavaScript version of the PythonTutor</a>, now is a perfect time to do so!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_adventures_in_javascript_land">Adventures in JavaScript Land</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re starting to feel confident in the basics and need a bit of a change of pace (primary focus should still be on progressing through freeCodeCamp!) the following are great places to play and practice what you&#8217;re learning:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a> - You can start playing with CodeWars after about the first 1/4 of freeCodeCamp&#8217;s "Basic JavaScript" exercises (about 16 hours into their series, but that assumes absolutely <em>no</em> prior knowledge, if you have any then you&#8217;ll fly through it faster than that!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d hold off playing around with the rest until you&#8217;ve finished at least the freeCodeCamp&#8217;s "Basic JavaScript" exercises (by their estimates, another 8 hours or so).  And —<em>coming from experience</em>— don&#8217;t let them distract you from actually moving forward on your primary goals!</p>

<p>In your JavaScript adventures you will explore and use many other tools and technologies.  The following are some common themes and thoughts for your journey.</p>

<h3 id="_editors">Editors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of novices ask about editors.  Developers tend to develop strong preferences, so you should be comfortable working with any editor.  That said, here are some thoughts on editors.</p>

One thing I&#8217;ve noticed about senior developers is the propensity to turn to their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">web console</a>.  It&#8217;s still something I&#8217;m working on, but if you can do something in the console, you should consider doing that instead of using a full-blown editor.

<p>This is my current go to editor.  It&#8217;s not open source, but it does have a great ecosystem of modules.  A license is $70, but it is worth noting that a license isn&#8217;t <em>necessary</em> for Sublime 2.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t used it yet, but a fellow JS developer I know has come to love it.  I&#8217;ll get around to trying it one day, but if you&#8217;re just starting, this is probably a great place to start.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re just starting to program, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> recommend starting with vim, but I have several senior friends that use it and are <em>amazingly</em> productive with it.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_css">CSS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While HTML and CSS are not JavaScript, if you&#8217;re using JavaScript then there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll also need to use HTML and CSS.  CSS is an interesting markup language and is pretty powerful in its own right.  If you want to have some fun learning about CSS3 or FlexBox (a subset of CSS3), than I highly recommend you checkout the <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> and <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tdd">TDD</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Test-Driven Development is a wonderful thing, but as a novice it can be overwhelming.  I encourage Learners' to start practicing TDD when they start working through <a href="http://codekata.com/">CodeKata</a>.  It has it&#8217;s own flavor of TDD, but the principals will carry over to other TDD libraries.  Writing your own tests for CodeKatas helps you work through the principals of TDD.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_framework_of_the_moment">Framework of the Moment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will run into Javascript frameworks left and right during your JavaScript adventures (e.g. Angular, React, Meteor, Aurelia, Ember, Backbone, Vue).  <em>Don&#8217;t</em> spend time learning them until you&#8217;ve got the basics down or absolutely need to use a specific library (e.g. for a job).  Developing proficiency in core JavaScript will get you further than proficiency in a particular framework but lacking proficiency in core JavaScript.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_github_vs_gitlab">GitHub vs GitLab</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you&#8217;re learning JavaScript, and pretty much any other modern open-source programming languages, you&#8217;ll see a lot of projects and what not on GitHub (I&#8217;m pretty sure freeCodeCamp now encourages you to get an account before you even start coding).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is the go-to for most open-source projects, but for personal projects I much prefer and strongly recommend, <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>.  Pretty much anything that GitHub does GitLab does, plus GitLab does a lot more (for example, allowing you to have private projects for free).  The important caveat is that private projects on GitLab are, well, private.  In other words, you won&#8217;t be building up a highly visible trail of code.  If you&#8217;re looking for a job, then a trail of code is something that employers can reference, just like a portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m MetaSean on both (<a href="https://github.com/metasean" class="bare">https://github.com/metasean</a> ; <a href="https://gitlab.com/u/metasean" class="bare">https://gitlab.com/u/metasean</a>).  I look like I&#8217;m more active on GitHub only because of things I do with projects already hosted there and because I have private repos on GitLab and so you won&#8217;t see my activity on those ('cause private).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_quack_quack">Quack, Quack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo (DDG)</a> !bangs - I love DDG for many different reasons, one of which is their !bangs.  !bangs are basically shortcuts for different sites, resource types, and a handful of other things.  In a DDG search bar you can press "!" (without the quotes) and it will show you the most popular !bangs as well as a link to a very, very, very long list of all the available !bangs (did I mention they have a lot of !bangs!)</p>
